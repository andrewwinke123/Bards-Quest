To play, you will cycle through multiple choice prompts in a looping path that takes you through The Wizard Glik's tower as you try to escape. You will need to pay attention to any clues you may find to make your escape.

# ATTRIBUTIONS

I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Github to make this game.

I would like to thank Sierra On-Line for making King's Quest 3 which inspired me to make this story.

I would also like to thank [css-tricks.com](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/typewriter-effect/) for my typewriter animation

I got my typing audio from [this youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY4FIuYg9kE)

I got my fonts from google fonts and used the font Raleway

My pictures were all turned into vector images and edited/mashed together by me, but they'er source material was found at various websites:

# NEXT STEPS:

I am going to add a timed-event where the Wizard Glik arrives home and you must hide what you are doing from him during a prompt

More unique sound effects for each event that happens

I want to add a parse input function with a word bank library

Eventually, I would like to add an actual game board where you can walk around and explore a 2d over-world just like the King's Quest series
