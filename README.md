Bard's Quest!
A text based adventure game based off of King's Quest 3! Do YOU love parse input games from decades past? 
How about text based adventure games loosely based on niche parse input games from decades past?
Well I have the game for you. Bard's Quest.

To play, you will cycle through multiple choice prompts in a looping path that takes you through The Wizard Gliks tower as you try to escape. You will need to pay attention to any clues you may find to make your escape.

I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git to make this game.

I would like to thank Sierra On-Line for making King's Quest 3 which inspired me to make this story.

I would also like to thank https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/typewriter-effect/ for my typewriter animation

NEXT STEPS:

I am going to add a timed event in where the Wizard Glik arrives home and you must hide what you are doing

More unique sound effects for each event that happens

I am also going to add one or two very simple mini games

I want to add a parse input function with a modern word bank library

Eventually, I would like to add an actual gameboard where you can walk around and explore an overworld just like King's Quest 3.
