To play, you will cycle through multiple choice prompts in a looping path that takes you through The Wizard Glik's tower as you try to escape. You will need to pay attention to any clues you may find to make your escape.

## Attributions

I would like to thank Sierra On-Line for making King's Quest 3, which inspired me to make this story.

I would also like to thank [css-tricks.com](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/typewriter-effect/) for my typewriter animation.

I got my typing audio from [this youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY4FIuYg9kE).

I got my fonts from Google Fonts and used the font Raleway.

I styled my buttons with the help of [getcssscan.com](https://getcssscan.com/css-buttons-examples).

My pictures were all turned into vector images and edited/mashed together by me, but their source material was found on various websites:

And here are some of my [planning materials](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ThFBmxCyaJQzrHqkZ4ivg4am-BzQDFAs2KUK4bp-9rc/edit).

## Next Steps

- I will add a timed event where the Wizard Glik arrives home, and you must hide what you are doing from him during a prompt.

- Add unique sound effects for each event.

- I want to add a parse input function with a word bank library.

- A user interface that feels more like a computer from the 80s with a clue or two hidden in the margins of the UI.

- Eventually, I would like to add a game board where you can walk around and explore a 2d over-world like the King's Quest series.
